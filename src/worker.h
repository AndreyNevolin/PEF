/**
 * Structure to keep shared high-level summary of work done by worker so far
 *
 * The way the workers update these structures depends on whether progress monitoring was
 * requested by a user:
 *     1) if monitoring is requested, then the monitor thread reads execution summary of
 *        each worker once per every accumulation period (the length of the period is
 *        given by a user). Thus, the statistics summary structures are not private to
 *        workers in presence of monitoring. Access to them is protected by locks in this
 *        case. Locks make access to the structures expensive. To mitigate this negative
 *        impact, workers don't update their execution summary too often. Each worker can
 *        update its summary not more than 2 times during the accumulation period
 *     2) in absence of monitoring, the summary structures are private to workers, and the
 *        workers update them whenever thay have something to say

/**
 * Structure to keep private high-level execution summary of worker
 *
 * While a worker is running, only it is allowed to access its private execution summary
 * structure. After the worker is finished, the structure can be accessed by other
 * threads.
 *
 * In constrast to "shared execution summary", workers can update their "private execution
 * summary" as frequently as they like. That's because accessing this structure is cheap.
 * (While accessing "shared execution summary" may be expensive because it may require
 * acquiring a lock).
 *
 * Example: both "private" and "shared" execution summaries have "tasks_completed" field.
 *          But in the first case this field is always equal to the actual number of
 *          tasks completed by the worker so far. While in the second case, if monitoring
 *          is enabled, the field may lag significantly behind the actual number of
 *          completed tasks.
 *          The shared version of "tasks_completed" counter is used for progress tracking
 *          purporses. The precise number of completed tasks is not absolutely necessary
 *          for progress tracking.
 *          PEF relies on the private version of "tasks_completed" when emitting the
 *          detailed execution report. Workers no longer exist by that time. Hence, all
 *          their execution artifacts may be accessed freely. After a worker ceases to
 *          exist, its private summary structure still keeps the exact number of tasks
 *          completed by the worker. This is particularly useful when a worker fails or
 *          gets cancelled before it completes ALL assigned tasks.
