# This script produces bandwidth report from PEF execution report
#
# The script assumes that:
#   1) PEF summary report contains the size of task in bytes. The size is the same for
#      all tasks
#   2) each line of the detailed PEF report - except the first one - describes a
#      single task. The lines are sorted increasingly by the absolute task completion
#      time
#
# The script produces one output file. The name of the file is based on the name of the
# PEF report files. While the names of the PEF report files have the form
# "pef_YYYY-MM-DD__HH:MM:SS__stat" (with the corresponding extensions), the output file
# of this script will have the name of the form "pef_YYYY-MM-DD__HH:MM:SS__bw.report"
#
# The output file contains a table. The table has a row for every N records of the
# detailed PEF report. N is given to the script as a command-line argument. There are two
# columns in the table. The meaning of the columns is the following:
#   1) the first column contains time in seconds since the beginning of the PEF
#      benchmark. This is time when the last task in a portion of N tasks was completed
#   2) bandwidth averaged over the corresponding period of time (i.e. the period during
#      which the corresponding N tasks were running)
